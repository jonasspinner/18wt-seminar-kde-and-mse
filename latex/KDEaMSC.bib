@article{Botev.2010,
 abstract = {We present a new adaptive kernel density estimator based on linear diffusion processes. The proposed estimator builds on existing ideas for adaptive smoothing by incorporating information from a pilot density estimate. In addition, we propose a new plug-in bandwidth selection method that is free from the arbitrary normal reference rules used by existing methods. We present simulation examples in which the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

@article{CarreiraPerpinan.,
 abstract = {A natural way to characterize the cluster structure of a dataset is by finding regions containing a high density of data. This can be done in a nonparametric way with a kernel density estimate, whose modes and hence clusters can be found using mean-shift algorithms. We describe the theory and practice behind clustering based on kernel density estimates and mean-shift algorithms. We discuss the blurring and non-blurring versions of mean-shift; theoretical results about mean-shift algorithms and Gaussian mixtures; relations with scale-space theory, spectral clustering and other algorithms; extensions to tracking, to manifold and graph data, and to manifold denoising; K-modes and Laplacian K-modes algorithms; acceleration strategies for large datasets; and applications to image segmentation, manifold denoising and multivalued regression.},
